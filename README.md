# RNA-seq analysis

This repostiory contains code for the analysis of RNA-seq data from total cortex and synaptoneurosome preparations of WT and FUS KI mice. Preprocessing and differential gene expression analysis were performed with the [ARMOR workflow](https://github.com/csoneson/ARMOR). The `Rmd/` directory contains rmarkdown files for further exploratory analyses and comparisons to other data sets.
